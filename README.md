# Lili's Addons
A collection of addons I wrote for Final Fantasy XI, compatible with the [Windower launcher](http://windower.net/).

DONATE TO SUPPORT: dunno how send me a mail and we'll figure something out.

Addons to fix issues on private servers:
- chatfix (fixes empty or garbled chat messages)
- menufix (fixes crash when opening the status menu)
- tellfix (fixes empty or garbled tell messages)

Utilities:
- clickfind (click to print mouse cursor position on screen)
- posfind (click to print character position on world map)
- mousehalo (makes your mouse cursor MUCH more visible. A bit facetious, but working.)

Complete addons:
- Smeagol: automatically use CP/XP rings (and gear).
- Dupefind: find identical items scattered across different inventory bags.
- Dramagen: the only and last parser you will ever need.
- Indi-Nope: removes graphical effect from Indi-Spells.
- Witness Protection: assigns random persistent names to characters and linkshells that appear on screen (anonymize your screen)
- Silt Tracker: track earnings of Silt and Beads in Escha/Reisenjima.  
- TPSReport: exports an XML list of current alliance members.
- special: makes you feel special.
- position_manager: frontend for the wincontrol plugin to set position and screen size per character. DO NOT USE THIS, download it from windower instead.
- statsearch: full text search of the gear you own, filtered (or not) by job. Need to know what pieces you can equip that have Magic Defense? Now you can.
- collector: display owned and missing items from an item set. Want to know how many reive capes you have? Pulse weapons? Llith drops?
- tellapart: add progressive letters to mobs with identical names: Mandragora A, Mandragora B, Mandragora C, etc, instead of endless identical Mandragoras.

Incomplete addons:
- Friendzone: automatically calls trusts over and over. A bit bugged but workable.
- SafeOboro: makes everybody around Oboro in Port Jeuno disappear, so that you don't have any risk whatsoever of trading to scammers. Might make the zone laggy.
- JobInit: like init.txt, but specific per character per job.
- kaomoji: minimal kaomoji support for ffxi (behaves like /shrug /tableflip and /unflip do on discord)
