# Readable

Readable is a Windower addon for Final Fantasy XI that makes in-game text easier to read.

## What it does
- Converts large numbers of seconds (e.g. `123456 seconds`) into an `HH:MM:SS` timestamp.
- Formats large numbers (e.g. `12345678` â†’ `12,345,678`). The separator is configurable.

## Future plans
- Remove Mayakov's lisp.
- Improve readability for other NPCs (looking at you, Tarus...). Let me know which ones bother you most!

## Notes
- The addon will auto-update.
